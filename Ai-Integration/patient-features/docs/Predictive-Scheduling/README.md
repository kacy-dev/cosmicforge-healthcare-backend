# Predictive Scheduling Feature for Telemedicine App

## Overview

The Predictive Scheduling feature uses AI and machine learning to optimize appointment scheduling in our telemedicine application. It analyzes historical data, patient information, and external factors to suggest optimal appointment times, reducing no-shows and improving overall efficiency.

## Components

1. Data Collection (data_collector.py)
2. Data Preprocessing (data_preprocessor.py)
3. Machine Learning Model (model_trainer.py)
4. Appointment Optimization (optimizer.py)
5. Real-time Integration (real_time_integrator.py)
6. API Endpoints (main.py)

## Process Flow

1. **Data Collection**: 
   - Gathers historical appointment data, patient information, and provider details.
   - Includes factors like appointment type, duration, patient history, and provider specialization.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleans and prepares data for the machine learning model.
   - Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and normalizes numerical features.
   - Creates relevant features like day of week, time of day, patient's appointment history, etc.

3. **Machine Learning Model**:
   - Trains on historical data to predict the likelihood of appointment success.
   - Uses algorithms like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting.
   - Periodically retrained to maintain accuracy.

4. **Appointment Optimization**:
   - Uses the ML model's predictions to suggest optimal appointment times.
   - Considers factors like provider availability, patient preferences, and predicted success probability.

5. **Real-time Integration**:
   - Continuously updates the model with new appointment data.
   - Ensures the system adapts to changing patterns and remains accurate over time.

## API Endpoints

1. **Predict Appointments**:
   - Endpoint: POST `/api/predictive-scheduling/suggestions`
   - Provides AI-driven suggestions for optimal appointment times.

2. **Update Model**:
   - Endpoint: POST `/api/predictive-scheduling/update`
   - Updates the ML model with new appointment data and outcomes.

## Real-Life Usage Scenario

1. **Patient Requests Appointment**:
   - Patient logs into the telemedicine app and requests an appointment.
   - They provide their preferred dates and appointment type.

2. **System Generates Suggestions**:
   - The app calls the `/api/predictive-scheduling/suggestions` endpoint.
   - The ML model considers the patient's history, appointment type, provider availability, and external factors.
   - It returns a list of suggested appointment slots, ranked by likelihood of success.

3. **Patient Selects Appointment**:
   - The app presents the suggested slots to the patient.
   - Patient chooses one of the suggested times or requests alternatives.

4. **Appointment Confirmation**:
   - Once the patient confirms, the appointment is scheduled.
   - The system updates provider availability accordingly.

5. **Post-Appointment Update**:
   - After the appointment occurs (or is missed), the app calls the `/api/predictive-scheduling/update` endpoint.
   - This endpoint updates the ML model with the appointment outcome (attended, no-show, or cancelled).

6. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - The system periodically retrains the ML model using the latest data.
   - This ensures the scheduling suggestions improve over time, adapting to changing patterns.
